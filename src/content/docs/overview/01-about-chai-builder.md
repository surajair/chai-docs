title: What is ChaiBuilder?
description: Learn about ChaiBuilder - the powerful React-based visual website builder that combines the flexibility of code with the simplicity of visual design.
---

ChaiBuilder is a revolutionary visual website builder built on top of **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. It bridges the gap between visual simplicity and technical flexibility, empowering both developers and content creators to build beautiful, high-performance websites.

## 🎯 Our Mission

**Make website building efficient, flexible, and enjoyable for everyone.**

Whether you're a developer who wants to speed up prototyping, a designer who needs more control over the final output, or a content creator who wants independence from developers - ChaiBuilder is designed for you.

## 🚀 Evolution Story

ChaiBuilder's journey began as a simple tool for creating Tailwind CSS UI components - similar to a component library builder. As the project evolved and we listened to our community, it transformed into something much more powerful:

**From Component Builder** → **To Complete Website Builder** → **To Extensible Platform**

Today, ChaiBuilder is a comprehensive platform that serves everyone from individual creators to large development teams.

## 💡 Core Philosophy

### 🎨 Visual First, Code When Needed
Build visually with drag-and-drop simplicity, but never sacrifice the power to customize with code when needed.

### ⚛️ React Native Architecture  
Built entirely with React, ensuring compatibility with the entire React ecosystem and modern development practices.

### 🎯 Content-Focused Design
Optimized for content-heavy websites, blogs, and marketing sites while remaining flexible enough for any use case.

### 🔧 Developer-Friendly Output
Generate clean, semantic HTML and CSS that developers actually want to work with.
